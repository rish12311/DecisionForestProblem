The focus of this assignment is to implement decision tree algorithms (ID3 and CART) and experiment with TensorFlowâ€™s Decision Forest (TF-DF) library to build Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees models for predicting in-hospital mortality.

Assignment Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, and outlier detection.
Decision Tree Algorithms:
Implement ID3 and CART for patient datasets, using Scikit-Learn and custom implementations.
Analyze and compare performance for both ID3 and CART approaches.
Random Forest with TensorFlow: Train and test a Random Forest model on patient data and visualize the first decision tree.
Gradient Boosted Trees: Train GBDT models on the dataset and compare accuracy and log loss with Random Forest.
Feature Importance: Analyze feature importance for both Random Forest and GBDT.
Requirements
Libraries: TensorFlow Decision Forests, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn.
Dataset: MIMIC dataset with patient vitals.
